# Arlag√•rden Plus

- Goal: provide Arla's farmers with 
a solution where they can fill out a survey with statistics about their 
farm's sustainability and track their and other farms' progress
- Developed in a group of 4. 
- We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase for authentication and as a database (the database expired, so you won't be able to see the charts, but the rest of the app is working)
